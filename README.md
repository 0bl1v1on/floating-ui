# 3D Floating User Interface

A simple 3D, floating UI experiment that showcases various medieval weaponry.

### Information
The setup consists of a primary menu which lists a number of weapons types, and two details panels to display the selected content. Scrolling through the menu triggers a highlighted effect on the current item to indicate its focus, and selecting an item pans the camera over to the details panels which are populated with information based on the selection. The details panels are made up of two panes - the left displaying a set of models representing the selected weapon type, and the right providing textual information.
